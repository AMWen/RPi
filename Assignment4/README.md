1. Provide the code requested in GPIOInput.swift - 50 Points total as marked
2. Provide the code requested in LEDService.swift - 30 points total as marked
3. Deploy your server to your Raspberry Pi exactly as in Assignment3. Once the modified server is up and running, run the testLED.sh script from your mac to turn the LED on the Pi on and off across the internet.  Now verify that your button or touch sensor correctly turns the LED on or off and that the analog sensor properly reads changes in the state of the sensor.
